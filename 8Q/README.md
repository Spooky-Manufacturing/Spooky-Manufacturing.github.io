# Status: Moving Towards PCB!

We're beginning to layout the components and finalize the design of our quantum computer! As we continue to design the PCB, we are also working with optical engineers to make our logic gates more compact which will enable us to shrink the design even further than we already have!

### Development Board

To speed up R&D, we've decided to replace the ARM CPU with a QSeven2.0 spec'd "computer on module". There are a variety of benefits to doing this, one major benefit being that we can switch between a variety of x86 and ARM processors.

The current design effort utilizes the Congatech A50 CoM.

### QController

The QController acts as a bridge between the main (digital) computer and the quantum processor. It is responsible for storing/executing instructions, and for transferring data to/from the host and QPU.

## Features

![Feature List](./docs/source/imgs/8q.png)

* Quad-Core Cortex-A53
* Mali-T720 MP2 GPU
* 1x DDR4 Ram Slot (Max 64GB)
* 32/64 Bit Compatible
* Linux Capable
