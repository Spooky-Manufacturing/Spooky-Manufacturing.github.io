## Spooky Manufacturing, LLC.

### Who We Are
Spooky Manufacturing is an open-source quantum computing startup based in Phoenix, Arizona.

### Our Mission
We are dedicated to bringing quantum computing to the masses through designing, manufacturing, and programming open-source and open-hardware quantum computers.

### Affordability
Unlike many current quantum computer startups, our computers are based on photons that are easily manipulated with simple mirrors rather than atomic-based quantum computing which requires entire warehouses and million dollar lab equipment to accomplish; our computers can be built using off-the-shelf components.

### DIY 
Because our computers are designed to use off-the-shelf components, anyone with minimal tooling can build our quantum computers and circuits, whether industrially or in your own home making experimenting a breeze!
